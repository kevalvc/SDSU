Base case: k=1. Suppose that you want to change a value x between c1=1 (inclusive) and c2=5 (not inclusive), i.e. 1≤x<5. Then, the greedy will take a coin of k=1 and will set x←x−1. That the greedy solves here optimally is more or less trivial.

Induction hypothesis: k. The greedy solves optimally for any value of x such that ck−1≤x<ck.

Induction step: k+1. Show that the greedy solves optimally for any value of x such that ck≤x<ck+1. Then, they use this table that you mention to show that this problem reduces to solving for x←x−ck for which 0≤x−ck<ck+1−ck, which has been treated in the induction hypothesis.

Note that the table - which is the main part of the proof - can be constructed only for specific values of the coins. It does not hold for any possible choice of coin denominations, as they show in their next slide.
